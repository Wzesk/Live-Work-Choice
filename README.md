# GOALS
Research suggests that high-density neighborhoods in which the residents live and work, dramatically reduces the carbon footprint of the city by eliminating commuting related emissions [UK Department for Business, 2019].  In addition to the environmental benefits, the commingled density offers provides social benefits by increasing the intensity and variety of human interaction.

Achieving this dense, “live-work balance” in Kendall Square represents a transformation from the current state -- a migration embodied in a multitude of individual choices.  This investigation seeks to enhance our understanding of the relationships between:

1. The ideal migration in terms of impact on carbon footprint
2. The underlying choices constituting this migration
3. Changes required in the city to influence those chosed and accomodate the result
4. The future form of the live-work balanced city
